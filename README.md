# Pomodoro

This is a simple Pomodoro timer app built with React. It allows users to set a work timer and a break timer, and then it will automatically switch between the two.

## Installation

To install the app, simply clone the repository and run `npm install`.

## Usage

To use the app, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You will see a simple interface with two buttons: "Start Work" and "Start Break".

When you click the "Start Work" button, the timer will start counting down from the specified work time. When the timer reaches zero, it will automatically switch to the break timer.

When you click the "Start Break" button, the timer will start counting down from the specified break time. When the timer reaches zero, it will automatically switch back to the work timer.
